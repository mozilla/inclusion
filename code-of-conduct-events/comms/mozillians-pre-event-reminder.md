[Your Greeting],

[Event Name] is this weekend!  For those that aren’t aware - this event is a brilliant opportunity to [quick detail of opportunity].

For those fortunate enough to attend [Event Name], and for the benefit of others representing Mozilla at events all over the world, and within our own spaces - I wanted to provide a reminder, that Mozilla's Community Participation Guidelines ("CPG") go with us.   And this is a good thing!  Thinking deeply about how we can be more inclusive in our interactions will bring (I promise)  greater insight, more ideas, and diverse allies.

It’s also true that at events like this, we hold Mozillians accountable for behaviors that violate the right of others to fully participate; to feel respected, consulted, safe and included.  And in this light, we ask you and your teams review the CPG prior to attending any event, to please consider your impact, and to please look out for each other.  

[Your Closing]
