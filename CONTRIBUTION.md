## How to submit changes

Once you've identified one of the issues above that you feel you can contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository!

1. **[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository**. This makes your own version of this project you can edit and use.

```

    Example:

    git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<repository>.git
    
```

2. **[Create a Branch](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches)**If you already have the repo, please be sure that you have upstream merged into your master branch. And then create the branch. There is some [info](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork) available at about syncing repositories.

```

    Example:

    git checkout -b <branch>

```

3. **[Make your changes](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes)**! You can do this in the GitHub interface on your own local machine. Once you're happy with your changes. If there are a bunch of commits and those are adding things, fixing a couple of typos, etc, please consider merging some of those into a smaller set of commits. This helps to review the whole process. More [info](https://blog.carbonfive.com/2017/08/28/always-squash-and-rebase-your-git-commits/).

```

    Example:

    git add <changed file>
    git commit -m "<description of change>"

```

If this step sounds a bit difficult, the maintainers of the repository can help with this process when merging the PR.

3. **Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)**. This opens a discussion around your changes and lets the project lead know you are proposing changes.

```

    Example:

    git push origin <branch>

```

4. **[Document Commit](https://medium.com/@steveamaza/how-to-write-a-proper-git-commit-message-e028865e5791)** Start the sentences with a capital letter, write a short sentence (usually no more than ~70 characters) and use that as you use the subject of an email.
    If you want to add more information, leave a blank line
    And then start the paragraph you want to write down (please remember the limitation of 70 characters).
