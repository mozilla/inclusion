### Members on Break/Paused

From time to time, and for many reasons that life gives us, one of our community team members may need to reduce or pause their involvement for a while. We might still see them in chat channels, or commenting on bugs, but we have no expectations of regular availability.

### Alumni/Emeritus (choose a term)

Emeritus status honors those who have dedicated time and talent to the project, but have needed to step back for any of a variety of reasons. While they may not be actively contributing here any longer, we want to make sure they remain a visible part of the project's history and success.

- If you think we've missed anyone that should be included here, please contact someone on the  team.

### Review Periods

Once per year, we'll check in with our team members (both _active_ and _on break_) to ensure they are feeling supported, and to check if they will remain active on our team for the coming months. If we do not hear back from members at check-in time, they will be transitioned to an emeritus role.
