# Inclusive Leadership - Maintainer Contributions

> Overall Project Goal: Project Goal: An increase % in contribution typically done by project maintainers (pull request review, responding to, and trying to replicate issues).

### (Principle #1) Community/project leadership should be setup for regular review & renewal
- [ ] Do you provide ways for people to provide feedback on those in this role already? 
- [ ] Are we clear about ways people can step up, and also step down if they feel burnt out? 
- [ ] For those who step down, are there ways their contribution remains recognized?
- [ ] Is there a very visible invitation for people to take on review of PRs, and issues?

### (Principle #2) Leadership should be distributed
- [ ] Is leadership/maintainer tasks distributed, or is there one person with the majority of influence? 
- [ ] Are there visibly diverse people in roles of influence?  (age, language, timezone, gender identity)

### (Principle #3) Leadership should be accountable
- [ ] Are people already doing this work (staff or contributors) accountable to a set of responsbiltiies ? 
- [ ] Are their roles, and responsiblities publicly documented? 
- [ ] Is it clear, how those roles will be held accountable, and by whom?

### (Principle #4) Is our Governance setup to support and protect diverse participation?
- [ ] Do you have a Code of Conduct
- [ ] Is it enforced?
- [ ] Do people know and trust that your CoC is enforced?

### (Principle #5) Leadership should be consistent
- [ ] Do we treat everyone in roles of influence equally? 
- [ ] Do we give  less space to the loudest voices, native English speakers, or time-zones? Imagine the impact on a quieter person, non-native English speaker outside of North America

### (Principle #6)  Leadership should include Technical and  non-technical experts
- [ ] Maintainer-like roles require non-technical skill, including engagement of those opening issues, documentation and community engagement. Do you explicitly invite these skillsets to step up as well?
