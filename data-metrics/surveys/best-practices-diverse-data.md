## Best Practices (and Rules)for Handling Diverse Data

NOTE:This is a work in progress.

Collecting diverse demographics data is important in helping open projects like Mozilla understand the impact of interventions we make to be a more inclusive, and welcoming project.
That said, it's important to always ensure you know why you are asking for sensitive data.  Here are some prompts.

Always include Mozilla's privacy policy.

* If you are asking for **gender identity**, how will you use that data? If you don't know, don't ask.
* If you are asking whether someone is **transgender** how do you intend to benefit that demographic with your findings?  If you dont know, don't ask.
* In some regions it is illegal to collect gender data from those under 19. Add checkbox to ensure people are over 19.
* If you are collecting personally identifying information like name, email, Github ID AND gender identity information, do you have in place:
  * Legal approval
  * Standards for handling this data, that will ensure results are anonymotized beyond any recognition.
