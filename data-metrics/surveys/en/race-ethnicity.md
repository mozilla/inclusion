# Race/ethnicity

This standard is based on the following research and reading:

* Ford Foundation Diversity Questions
* Open Demographics [Open Pull Request](https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics/issues/14) from @brihijoshi
* [Diffference between ethnic group and tribe](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-ethnic-group-and-vs-tribe/)
* [Ethnic Classification in Global Perspective](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-20095-8_2.pdf)

How you ask about Race/Ethnicity varies wildly between regions, countries.
Currently we recommend you research the country/region you are interested in asking this question, and investigate census and other existing standards already being used.   

Alternately, allow people to self-identify.
