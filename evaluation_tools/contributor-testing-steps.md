# Contributor Testing Steps
This is a small script that we adapt (on a per project basis) as a type of'user testing' aka 'contributor testing'.  Participants must not be familiar with the project, code or community, although they should be confident with the technology.

Steps should allow for someone reasonably confident with the technology to do a scan of project assets, people and tinker with the environment in 1.5 hours or less. It's OK if the environment build is not completed, the intention is to see how well a project is setup to accommodate those without luxury of hours of time to figure things out.


## Actions (5 minutes)

1. Open Your browser, and navigate to the project main page (provide this link).

2. Do you have questions still, of so what are they?

## Getting Started Actions ( 15 minutes)

## Questions
Even if you didn't finish...

1. How did that go?

## Community Actions ( 15 minutes)

1. Find the Code of Conduct.
2. Find information on the community leaders and staff.
3. Log into the chat channel and say hi.
4. Review the contributing document (CONTRIBUTING.md usually, but sometimes the README.md)


## Questions

1. How did that go?
2. What did you observec about the community channel?
3. If you found information on the community leaders/staff how did that information make you feel more or less likely to contribute?
4. Based on the contributing document, do you feel about contributing?  What would you attempt first?
5. Is it easy to understand who to ask for help, and who project leaderhip is?

## Environment (Remaining Time)

1. Complete the environment build steps, use the community channel to ask for help if you're stuck, or have questions.
