# Open Source Inclusion Basic Checklist


This checklist provides open source projects with basics for evaluating the inclusive design in key areas.  This checklist is intended to provide insight, and education.

## Governance

### Code of Conduct
A Code ofConduct sends an  signal to your project & community that you invested in creating a safe and empowered community for everyone, regardless of background, family status, gender, gender-identity or expression, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, native language, age, ability, race/ethnicity, national origin, socioenconimic status, religion, geographic location or any other dimension of diversity.

It's not enough to have a Code of Conduct. [Creating transparent, and effective processes for enforcement is key](https://medium.com/mozilla-open-innovation/how-were-making-code-of-conduct-enforcement-real-and-scaling-it-3e382cf94415).  The following questions represent the most basic requirements for establishing a CoC.  
*An advanced checklist will be available in the future*.


- [ ] We have a Code of Conduct ("CoC").
- [ ] Our Code of Conduct is visible from our main project page and/or repository root and linked from all communication channels.
- [ ] It is clearly stated in the COC how to report behaviors at that are illegal or make individuals/groups feel unsafe, unwelcome or uncomfortable .
- [ ] It is clear to whom that report will go.  This means names of people, and their individual email addresses.
- [ ] There is an option to reach out to only one of those people.
- [ ] We have a process for responding-to reports that ensures reporter, reported and all others impacted are regularly updated.

## Leadership
These are based on [CHAOSS working group criteria for inclusive leadership](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/focus_areas/leadership/assets/leadership-principles.md).  Leadership is central to project and community culture, and thus require intentional design, and accountability for the empowerment of others. 

- [ ] Our project leadership is designed with cycles of feedback and review to avoid gatekeeping and to encourage inclusive behavior.
- [ ] Responsiblities of leadership are clearly documented.
- [ ] Our project leadership 'leads by example' - expected behaviors outlined in our CoC.
- [ ] We recognize leadership equally, including non-technical leadership.
- [ ] We recognize 'empowering others' as a core attribute of leadership, and discourage self promotion.

## Project & Community Design
This section describes some simple ways your project and community design can be more inclusive.  

### Communication & Language
- [ ] We have a welcoming and open channel for community particpiation.
- [ ] We strive to avoid [jargon and other non-inclusive language](https://open.buffer.com/inclusive-language-tech/) that can alienate, and make underrepresented people feel excluded.
- [ ] We strive to encourage and recognizes the quietest voices, and not just those with the most confidence, and volume.

- [ ] We recognize that the the primary language of the project may not be the first language of all contributors, and where possible provide transcripts of meetings and other key project correspondence are easily found.

### Documentation

- [ ] We have taken one or more steps to improve the [accessiblity](https://www.comprend.com/blog/2017/test-your-websites-accessibility/) of our documentation/website?  

### Tasks
- [ ] We provide non-technical tasks for first-time contributors to learn about, and participate in our project.
- [ ] We label tasks that are for contributors, to help save time, and frustration for volunteer and maintainer.
