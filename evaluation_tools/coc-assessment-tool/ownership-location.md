As a very first step in reviewing a project Code of Conduct, ensure that it is:


* In the root of a repository.
  * Note: some projects on Github may have their CoC in a subfolder as per [SUPPORT file standards](https://blog.github.com/2017-07-20-support-file-support/). The Code of Conduct is **not a support file**.  (README, CONTRIBUTING are)
* And/or available from the main website.

## Encouraged
* Located in a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.MD or other dedicated-file.
* **Linked from README.md** , CONTRIBUTING.md and other first-contact places & spaces.

## Discouraged
* Embedded in a README.md or other file with participation/technical onboarding and other info.  

## Red flags
* Links to templates without modification. For example:  'We have adopted the Contributor Covenant' (linked out), provides no contact information for reporting.
