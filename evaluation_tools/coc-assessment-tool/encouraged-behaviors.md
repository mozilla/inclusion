A Code of Conduct is best used as a tool for community health.  'Encourged Behaviors', is a way to teach and encourage the behaviors that are most welcome, and important for success of project and community - and sets a positive tone.


For example...

> Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on
> PEPs, patches, problems, or otherwise. We're receptive to constructive
> comment and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other
> members contribute to the whole of our efforts. We're accepting of all
> who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment
> where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.[^14]
>
> The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community
> members:

> -   Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
> -   Attempt collaboration before conflict.
> -   Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
> -   Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.[^15]
> In addition to having a code of conduct as an anti-harassment policy,
> we have a small set of social rules we follow.[^16]

Statements that appear dismissive to people who have
experienced harassment and abuse:

-   “We’re all adults here” — age of participants doesn’t determine whether something causes harm
-   “Be excellent to each other” — this is a cultural reference that not all people will know, and it’s loosely defined
-   “Be nice” — also vague, and puts a higher value on overt politeness over whether harm is caused
-   “Don’t be a dick” or “don’t be an ass” — slang that’s open to interpretation

Statements about intention

- 'Assume good or best intentions', is not an effective way to resolve code of conduct issues. Whether someone intends to cause harm is separate from the impact.
