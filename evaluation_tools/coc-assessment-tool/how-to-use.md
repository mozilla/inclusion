To fully benefit from the potential of this resource we recommend the following steps:

1. Read, **in detail**, the Code of Conduct from top to bottom and capture initial reactions. How did it make you feel? Do you see everyone in your community or project represented? Capture your intuitive response, as well as factual ones.
2. Read this document in its entirety. Did anything jump out about the Code of Conduct you just read based on the criteria here?
3. Using this [marking grid](), step through this document and do a detailed analysis.

**After completing all steps, based on your marking grid, and notes, results should be organized into one of 3 groups**


**Acceptable (<span style="color:#009900"><em>Green</em></span>)**:

    This CoC contains all of the required elements and
    often uses details from the Encouraged examples. It may or may not
    have items from the Additional Elements.

**Needs Improvement (<span style="color:#FADA5E">Yellow<em></em></span>)**:

    This CoC contains most or all of the required
    elements with a mix of encouraged and discouraged text. It can
    move to Acceptable status by updating any missing elements and
    removing discouraged items. One or two red flags in an otherwise
    acceptable policy would also fall into this category.

**Unacceptable (<span style="color:#992600">Red<em></em></span>)**:

    This CoC is missing significant required elements
    and/or contains a number of red flags. It should be rebuilt from
    scratch rather than updated piecemeal.
