Reporting guidelines are critical not only to the procedural enforcement of a CoC, but sends a signal about whether or not the project is  serious about the document they've put together. **Trust is built here**.

An assessment of **harm**, **harassment**, or **abuse** should reflect
the impact on the person(s) who itâ€™s directed at. In addition, the
impact on the community as a whole should be taken into account.


## Required

-   Minimum information that will be required to make a report.
-   Contact information. If an alias is used, the names of those receiving alias.  

> **What happens after you file a report?**
>
> You will receive an email from the DSF Code of Conduct Working Group
> acknowledging receipt immediately. We promise to acknowledge receipt
> within 24 hours (and will aim for much quicker than that).[^17]

**NOTE:** in some cases a project will use role titles instead of real names, due to concern about harassment/trolling.  It's still important that one human name be provided for direct outreach.
