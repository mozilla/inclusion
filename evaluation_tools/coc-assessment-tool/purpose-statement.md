The Purpose Statement, is usually an introductory sentence or section. It should frame the use of a
Code of Conduct within the community’s values and goals.

Below, is an example of a positive purpose statement:

> A primary goal of this project is to be inclusive to the largest
> number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds
> possible.[^1]
>
> In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as\
> contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our
> project and our community a harassment-free experience for
> everyone[^2]

## Encouraged

This statement should **relate the policy to the general goals of the
project itself**, or the collaboration experience building that project.  

> Our goal with !!Con is to bring the NYC programming community together
> for a conference about the excitement, joy, and surprise of
> programming.
>
> We value the participation of each member of the community and want
> all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.[^3]

## Red Flags

-   Any statement that **prioritises the comfort of existing contributors over the inclusion of people with less status or access**.
-   Statements that put technical outcomes before participatory ones.
- Statements derived from religious or other belief systems, even if positive in intention.

Here is a historical example from the Linux Kernal - Code of Conflict putting technical outcomes before participatory ones.[^4]

> The Linux kernel development effort is a very personal process
> compared to “traditional” ways of developing software. Your code and
> ideas behind it will be carefully reviewed, often resulting in
> critique and criticism. The review will almost always require
> improvements to the code before it can be included in the kernel. Know
> that this happens because everyone involved wants to see the best
> possible solution for the overall success of Linux. This development
> process has been proven to create the most robust operating system
> kernel ever, and we do not want to do anything to cause the quality of
> submission and eventual result to ever decrease.[^4]
