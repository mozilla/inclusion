This email is to make you aware of a decision regarding [Name].  

**You are receiving this email as an administrator of a [orgname] system, where this person has an active account, and will be required to complete specific actions outlined below.**

In recent weeks Mozilla received multiple reports indicating [Name] acted in violation of our Community Participation Guidelines .
Based on these reports a working group generated recommendations for a level 7, permanent ban from Mozilla.  These recommendations were validated by a RASCI of Mozilla leadership, and in consultation with our team, and others at Mozilla.
Every effort was taken to ensure the reports were fair, accurate and represented the truth beyond doubt. We obviously cannot discuss details of the reports, out of respect for everyone involved. 

To help us ensure a complete ban, we ask that you disable this personâ€™s account on [system] where username is [username]. 
If you have any questions please reach out to myself, [othernames].

Thanks,
