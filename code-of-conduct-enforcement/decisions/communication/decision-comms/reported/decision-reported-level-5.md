### Temporary Ban

Dear [name],

I’m writing today in order to address your participation in the Mozilla community.


This email is to let you know that, in the last few weeks, [org name] received [x number of] reports that you violated Mozilla’s Community Participation Guidelines (“CPG”). These alleged violations took place in/at [location]. The actions that are alleged to have violated the CPG are:
Violation 1 - [CPG exact wording]
Violation 2 - [CPG exact wording]


These reports were reviewed, and an investigation conducted by [working group or names]. [org name] determined that a material portion of [violations] were substantiated to our satisfaction following [org name] investigative process.

The decision was made to [issue/enforce] a [# of weeks] mandatory ban from participation in [org name] communities and projects from [date] to [date]. This means:
* All accounts deactivated during this time.
* No interaction with any of the people involved.
* This includes avoiding any interactions in any official Mozilla channels, as well as external or unofficial channels like social media (Twitter, Facebook, Telegram). 
* No attendance at Mozilla events during this period.
* All community leadership roles suspended. 
* Not allowed to enter Mozilla Spaces (offices) during this period. 
* Mandatory CPG onboarding process after this period.

This pause will allow you to reflect on what your next steps are and consider how you wish to contribute to Mozilla going forward.  We trust that you will comply with the conditions of the pause, but the pause may be extended or made permanent in accordance with the consequence ladder if you do not.

After [end date of suspension] if you would like to be active in the community again, you will be required to attend a Community Participation Guidelines onboarding.  We will let you know at the onboarding which tools and community events you will receive access to immediately, and which you may be asked to not participate in for a longer period.

If you have any questions, or would like to schedule a 1:1 regarding the scope of this decision, please reply to this mail.  

Enforcement of our CPG is something Mozilla takes very seriously. All community members are held accountable to the standard set forth in the CPG. As a community leader, your behavior also sets the standard for others and signals what is, and is not, acceptable in our community. We hope this is an opportunity for you to re-evaluate your role within the community, and set positive goals for the future.


Your next step is to indicate you have received this email, and to let us know if you would like to schedule a 1:1 call in the next day or two. We will be in touch [date] to begin the reinstatement & onboarding process.

Kind regards,
[name]
