# FAQ  

Below is a list of popular questions, and some answers around the Community Participation Guidelines ("CPG") enforcement process and workflow.

### What is a CPG Onboarding?

CPG onboarding is often part of a decision involving behavior that results in a temporary ban. 
It is scheduled prior to the time of reinstatement, and is overall meant to be a positive and empowering experience.
It usually takes between 1/2 an hour to an hour, so we always set aside 1 hour. We use Vidyo, Google Hangouts, Skype, Telegram, or IRC depending on the preference and technology access of the individual.

A CPG onboarding typically covers these basic topics:
1. Review of decision, and how to avoid futher, more severe consequence. 
2. Reinstatement outline.  This is very dependent on the individual, and the violation - but is used to describe what a return to participation at Mozilla will look like.  There may be some permanent bans from certain channels, tools or events - but primarily this is about confirming reinstatement.
3. Welcome Back.  Setting this person up for success.


### In some portions of the Consequence Ladder, there's this requirement: "no interaction with people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the guidelines", what does that mean exactly?

Because the CPG outlines guidance for expected and not-tolerated behaviors in our community, chances are a violation has interfered with someone's ability to feel safe, empowered, and included in an interaction with you.  This also includes those who witness negative interactions.
'People Involved' refers to those people who have been directly and indirectly impacted by your behavior.  If you are not sure who these people are draw a wide circle around your interactions and use that as a guide.
For example if your violation happened in a particular channel, stay away from that channel or platform entirely unless otherwise directed.

This also includes those enforcing the CPG, which include (but not limited to) staff, volunteer leaders and the person who sends you decision emails. 

### How is Onboarding content created?

The decision making group, usually consisting of project area leads, as well as CPG enforcement leads are consulted on the specifics of the onboarding content.  It is personalized to the individual, while leveraging best practices learned in previous onboarding.
