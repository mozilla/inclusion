Dear [name],

Thank you for your [email/report], and provided information. In order to proceed, we need to better understand which actions and behaviors you are reporting as being in violation of the CPG.  To help us move more quickly, and with greater accuracy, please review the CPG and provide information specifically related.
For example you might say

    Disruptive Behavior - [person name]  screenshot example of that behavior.
    Derogatory language - [person name] screenshot example of that behavior.


The reason I ask this is because as part of investigation we have to provide this information to others, and it is much better to have your perspective, than for us to guess from [long transcript/bug reports] in entirety.
