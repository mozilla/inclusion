# Curriculum Goals (Brainstorming Draft)

### What are we building?
A compliment, or companion module for any course/content teaching 'the history of open source. Some examples I can find are (please add yours so we can reach out to those authors):

* http://teachingopensource.org/foss-category/foss-history/?post_types=learning_material,post_tag,tag
* https://emmairwin.github.io/learning-open-source/articles/open-is-an-attitude/history-of-open/

### Why are we building it? (please improve)

The history of free / open source, is primarily described as a history of actions and decisions by individuals - emphasis business, ecosystem and technology.

Culture, diversity, inclusion and equity are usually seperate, and yet the state of these, throughout history -  permitted, elevated and sustained the success and unchecked priveldge to certain people and groups; in parallel,  participation and voices of those not enabled, deterred or forced out were muted, or invisible.  

We are building this module, as an addon for existing content, to ensure that everyone just stepping into Open Source, has this bigger picture of history, and for benefit of the future. And to honour the stories, and shared experiences of those, who from these same periods of time were excluded, driven-out or whose contributions were/are excluded and/or invisible.  Ultimately that Free/.OS technology (including organizations built around these movements) then, and now remain primarily outputs of those most successful historically.

And of course, the potential for getting this right.

### Who is our audience?

* Students (higher education)
* Developers (already in their technology careers)

### How do we ensure quality?

### What format will this content be written in?

### What is out of scope?
